You may find otherwise.\n\nA few notes:\n\nThe box drawing characters are spaced such that guessed letters have a space between them to the nearest horizontal box drawing character.\nI maintain all letters in lower case. This is implicitly enforced by the requirement that guesses be members of WORDS\nThis is a 5 word Latin word list.
