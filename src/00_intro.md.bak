# Introduction

- Welcome to Willamette!
- Welcome to *Thinking Machines*
- We will learn:
    - Scientific computing, to learn...
    - Machine learning and artifical intelligence

## Course Description

> Artifical intelligence, machine learning, big data, and large scale computing have captured the collective imaginations of millions people across a range of technical expertise. Yet each of these buzzwords is rooted in a central promise: that machines may think.

## Background


- **Thesis Title**: [Mining Secure Behavior of Hardware Designs](https://cd-public.github.io/papers/2021/CD2021.pdf)  

>  Specification mining can discover properties that can verify the secure behavior of closed-source CISC CPU designs, the temporal correctness of CPU designs, and hyperproperties for secure information flow in modules, SoCs, and CPUs.  



## Background
- **Plain English**:  
  Just as there are bugs in code that make **software**, modern **hardware** is also written in code and therefore may contain bugs. I find these bugs.  
- Of note: I found those bugs *using scientific computing* (thinking machines).

## General Expectations

- **Students will begin the course with a grade of an "A".**
  - Students will be expected to:
    - Follow lecture.
    - Treat fellow students with respect.
    - Complete exercises.
    - Complete projects.

---

## Class/Exercises

- For an A (10/10)
    - Code that meets requirements.
    - On time.
- For a B (9/10)
    - Code that runs without error.
    - On time
- Erroneous code is an F (6/10)
- Late work is a zero (0/10)

---

## Feedback Structure

- Students collectively within the class as a whole will receive feedback..
  - Individual feedback will be provided in limited and unique cases.
  - Students are expected to provide respectfully collaborate on exercises.
  - Students may request individual feedback from the instructor at any time.
  - Students will receive narrative rather than quantitative feedback.

---

## Project/Website

- Students will create a public-facing scientific publication via:
    - Midterm: GitHub, Markdown, Python
    - Final: Quarto, GitHub Pages, Python
- Graded on the [AP Scale](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-english-language-and-composition-frqs-1-2-3-scoring-rubrics.pdf) as an argument essay and then curved.

# Group Exercise:

- Letâ€™s start the class off right away with an exercise designed for:
  - Groups  
  - Discussion  
  - Disagreement  
  - Deep critical thinking

## Aims of Education

- Before starting my first degree, we went to a lecture titled "Aims of Education"
- I completed all remaining degrees during shutdowns/other crises!
- I remember it fondly.
- We will review "Explainable AI for Climate Science" by Elizabeth Barnes.
  - And then discuss.
