## Announcements

- Enrichment assignment
    - Implementation of half precision IEEE 754 floating point values
    - Use bitwise operations
    - Use numeric operations
    - Combine them.

## Homework

- SHA beckons
- Due Friday, 10 Oct. at 1440 ET.
    - Do not work on this instead of that, after lab section today, until you are done with that.

## Citation

- Basically I try to take Python.Numpy.float16 as the reference implementation, but break from Python on float16 the same places `f32` breaks from `numpy.float32`.

# Struct

- Before anything else, have to find a way to make an `f16`.
    - We will just use a `u16` and treat it differently.
- We will make a custom data structure that contains precisely a `u16`

```rs
pub struct f16 {
    bits: u16,
}
```

- This probably goes in `lib.rs`
    - Hence the `pub`
    
- You can test that you created a type as follows:
```{.rs filename="src/main.rs"}
fn main() {
    let x : f16::f16;
}
```
- The first `f16` is the crate name, the second is the type name.

## Aside

- For my money, `f16::f16` looks terrible.
```{.rs filename="src/main.rs"}
use f16::*;

fn main() {
    let x : f16;
}
```

## Aside

- Rust will admonish you for using `f16` instead of `F16`. 
```sh
warning: type `f16` should have an upper camel case name
 --> src/lib.rs:1:12
  |
1 | pub struct f16 {
  |            ^^^ help: convert the identifier to upper camel case (notice the capitalization): `F16`
  |
  = note: `#[warn(non_camel_case_types)]` on by default
```
- Everyone is a critic!

## Aside

- We aren't really all the way to teaching structs yet, but feel free to play around with them.
- In particular, you want to have 3 fields, `sign`, `exp`, and `mantissa`, rather than a single `bits` field.
- The internal implementation is up to you with one exception:
    - Only use *integer* operations to emulate floating point operations.
    - (That's what we're trying to learn how to do here).
- You can read more on `struct` here:  [Rust Book 05.01](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html)


# Input/Output

- Versus built-in types, we'll just provide a ways to get values in and out.
- We'll use the Rust default integer, `i32`.

- Write the following functions:
```rs
fn i32_to_f16(n:i32) -> f16
fn print_f16(x:f16)
// optional, but i used it - print_f16 and a newline.
fn println_f16(x:f16)
```
- You may implement more complex handling, or set every overflow to `inf` and underflow to `0`.
- The following table should be helpful, from the lecture:

| Format | Sign | Exp.  | Mant. | Bits  | Bias | Prec. | 
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Half  | 1 | 5 | 10 | 16 | 15 | 11 |
| Single | 1 | 8 | 23 | 32 | 127 | 24 | 
| Double | 1 | 11 | 52 | 64 | 1023 | 53 | 
| Quad | 1 | 15 | 112 | 128 | 16383 | 113 |

- Here is an example:

```sh
1.512*2^3
[src/main.rs:4:5] println_f16(i32_to_f16(12)) = ()
1.944*2^6
[src/main.rs:5:5] println_f16(i32_to_f16(123)) = ()
1.210*2^10
[src/main.rs:6:5] println_f16(i32_to_f16(1234)) = ()
```

- Not the debug stating logging the function call prints after the value is displayed, as the debug statement is only printed *after* the function call returns.

## Aside

- It is admittedly odd to print values in decimal multpiplied by a power of 2.
- If you which to print in binary, simply prefix with `0b`
```sh
0b1.1000000000*10^11
[src/main.rs:4:5] println_f16(i32_to_f16(12)) = ()
0b1.1110110000*10^110
[src/main.rs:5:5] println_f16(i32_to_f16(123)) = ()
0b1.11010010*10^1010
[src/main.rs:6:5] println_f16(i32_to_f16(1234)) = ()
```
- I didn't find this easier (I just yeeted the output into Ye Olde Python III) but you may.

## Aside

- Speaking of yeeting, if you prefer this formulation:
```sh
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/bits`
1.512*2**3
1.944*2**6
1.210*2**10
```
- I won't say anything if you don't.
```py
>>> 1.512*2**3
12.096
>>> 1.944*2**6
124.416
>>> 1.210*2**10
1239.04
```

# Add/sub

- Write the following functions:
```rs
fn add_f16s(x:f16, y:f16) -> f16
fn sub_f16s(x:f16, y:f16) -> f16
```

# Mul/div

- Write the following functions:
```rs
fn mul_f16s(x:f16, y:f16) -> f16
fn div_f16s(x:f16, y:f16) -> f16
```

# Optional

## Implement infinities

- Ensure when any value is divided by zero, or any arithmetic results overflows, that the value is set to infinity.
- Ensure infinity is printed consistently, perhaps as `inf` or as unicode âˆž.
- Ensure positive and negative infinity.
- Ensure infinity matches IEEE 754 requirements:
    - Sign: Either.
    - Exponent: All `1`s.
    - Mantissa: All `0`s.
    
## Implement NaN

- Ensure when infinities of differing signs are summed (whether via add or sub), `NaN` is returned.
- Ensure when zero is divided by zero or `inf` by `inf` returns `NaN` or `nan` (up to you).
- Ensure any operations over `NaN` and any other value return `NaN`.
- Ensure `NaN` is printed consistently.
- Ensure `NaN` matches IEEE 754 requirements:
    - Sign: Either.
    - Exponent: All `1`s.
    - Mantissa: Anyting but all `0`s.
