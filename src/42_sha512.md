# Setup

## Requirements

- To complete this assignment, you must:
    - Create a `42` directory in your `271rs` repository.
    - This folder must be a Cargo package.
    - You may leverage other Cargo packages, provided you have written them.
        - Most likely "Macros"
        - [Read more]
```bash
cargo new 42 --name macros --vcs none
```

## My responsibility

- I will provide a reference solution
    - It is the command line utility `sha512sum` which I expect you already have on your system.
```sh
$ echo "hello world" > hi.txt
$ sha512sum hi.txt

```
    
## Your responsibility

- You will implement SHA-512 in Rust.
