# Setup

## Requirements

- To complete this assignment, you must:
    - Create a `72` directory in your `271rs` repository.
    - This folder must be a Cargo package.
    - As a convenience, I named mine `bignum` just to call it something other than `ix`, which was confusing.
```bash
cargo new 72 --name bignum --vcs none
```

## My responsibility

- I have provided a completing testing framework within the [I/O](70_ix_io.md) lab.
    
## Your responsibility

- You will implement:
    - `add_ix`
    - `sub_ix`
    - `mul_ix`
- You will attempt, but regard as a challenge problem:
    - `div_ix` and `rem_ix`, which are likely wrappers on the same "divmod" helper function.


## Tester

```py
DEBUG = 0
CMD = "cargo run --"

import subprocess, os, random
from operator import add, sub, mul, floordiv as quo, mod as rem

bigone, bigtwo = random.randint(2 ** 500, 2 ** 512), random.randint(2 ** 500, 2 ** 512)
hexone, hextwo = hex(bigone), hex(bigtwo)
DEBUG and print("\nhexone =\n", hexone, "\nhextwo = \n", hextwo)

from operator import add, sub, mul, floordiv as quo, mod as rem
ops = {'ADD':add,'SUB':sub,'MUL':mul,'QUO':quo,'REM':rem}
for op in ops:
    result = int(subprocess.check_output(["cargo", "run", hexone, hextwo, op]),16)
    answer = ops[op](bigone,bigtwo)
    if result != answer:
        print("Operator", op, "failed.")
        DEBUG and print("Expected:")
        DEBUG and print(hex(answer))
        DEBUG and print("Received:")
        DEBUG and print(hex(result))
        exit()
    else:
        print(op, "passes.")
```
