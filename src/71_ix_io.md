## Announcements

- Scaffolding assignment for `ix`
    - Big numbers are hard to type, think of, reason about, etc.
    - Hard to check your work.

## Homework

- `ix` beckons
- Due Friday, 24 Oct. at 1440 ET.
    - You will probably need to finish this to do that.
- `ix` vs. eg. `i32`, `i64`, can store infinite values, and your job is to make it.

## Today

- [ ] Struct
- [ ] Input/Output
- [ ] Addition/Subtraction
- [ ] Multiplication/Division
- [ ] Optional: Special cases

# Struct

- Before anything else, have to find a way to make an `ix`.
    - I am granting you full freedom to implement `ix` as you see fit with one exception:
    - You must implement it yourself, not use an existing "BigNum" or "BigInt" crate, like [this])(https://docs.rs/num-bigint/latest/num_bigint/struct.BigInt.html) 
- Personally, I just used a sign boolean and a vector of unsigned values. You are welcome to take this approach:

```{.rs filename="src/lib.rs"}
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]
pub struct ix {
    sign: bool,
    vals: Vec<u64>,
}
```
- The real merits of showing this are:
    - You can use `#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]` to avoid the annoying warning for a lower case name.
        - Naming a data structure in lower case is poor form (consider `String` vs. `&str`) but...
        - I was out of ideas.
- The structure is public, so can be used from a testing `src/main.rs`.
- The internal fields are not public, so you can make any changes you like within `src/lib.rs`.

## Test it
    
- You can test the same way we tested `f16`:
```{.rs filename="src/main.rs"}
fn main() {
    let x : f16::f16;
}
```
- The first `f16` is the crate name, the second is the type name.

## Aside

- For my money, `f16::f16` looks terrible.
```{.rs filename="src/main.rs"}
use f16::*;

fn main() {
    let x : f16;
}
```

## Aside

- Rust admonished you for using `f16` instead of `F16`. 
```sh
warning: type `f16` should have an upper camel case name
 --> src/lib.rs:1:12
  |
1 | pub struct f16 {
  |            ^^^ help: convert the identifier to upper camel case (notice the capitalization): `F16`
  |
  = note: `#[warn(non_camel_case_types)]` on by default
```
- Everyone is a critic!
- `#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]`

## Aside

- You can read more on `struct` here:  [Rust Book 05.01](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html)

# Input/Output

- Versus built-in types, we'll just provide a ways to get values in and out.
- Vs. `f16`, this won't be easy in the sense that we are explicitly trying to work with values that do not fit into any existing numerical type.
- For example, I will provide the following function, but it isn't particularly helpful.

```{.rs filename="src/main.rs"}
pub fn u64_to_ix(val: u64) -> ix {
    return ix {
        sign: false,
        vals: vec![val],
    };
}
```

- The real motivation for todays lab is to use a testing framework. 
- I am providing mine, which you are not required to use but that I quite like.
    - Values are input as command line arguments as hex strings, with a `0x` prefix.
        - I didn't check if I can input negative values, content to create negatives via subtraction rather than define a standard.
    - Values are output to `stdout` as hex values with no `0x` prefix but with a sign.
        - This was so I could read them directly with Python `int()` for testing.
    - Operations are specified using a capitalized, 3 letter abbreviation describing one of the four supported operations:
        - `ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, REM` - which I want to reiterate is four operations.
        - This should say "pattern matching" to you.
- I'll present the components of the testing framework, and your task is to convince yourself you understand them.

## `src/main.rs`

- Main:
    - Uses the `ix` implementation from `src/lib.rs`
    - Reads command line arguments generated by `tester.py`
    - Converts two  command line strings representing numerical hex vlaues into `ix` instances.
    - Captures the final command line argument to determine which operation to perform.
    - Calls the appropriate `ix` arithmetic function and captures its return value.
        - I call these `<op>_ix` for `op` in `add, sub, mul, div, rem`
    - Prints to `stdout` the returned `ix` as a hex string.
- While intended to be used by `tester.py`, it can also be used manually!
```sh
$ cargo run 0x10 0x20 ADD
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/bignum 0x10 0x20 ADD`
0000000000000030
```
- I do not add a newline after this value.
- You can, and probably should want to, make your own `src/main.rs` that does these things, but you are not required to do so.
- I am providing mine as a "spoiler marked" HTML `<details>` block.

### My `src/main.rs`

<details>
```{.rs filename="src/main.rs"}
use bignum::*;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
    let a = h2i_ix(&args[1]);
    let b = h2i_ix(&args[2]);
    match args[3].as_str() {
        "ADD" => see_ix(&add_ix(&a, &b)),
        "SUB" => see_ix(&sub_ix(&a, &b)),
        "MUL" => todo!(),
        "DIV" => todo!(),
        "REM" => todo!(),
        &_    => println!("Operator not recognized: choose from ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, REM"),
    }
}
```
</details>

## `tester.py`

- Tester:
    - Using Python's built-in integers, generates two large random numbers, I generated mine to be between 500 and 512 bits.
    - Convert them to hex strings.
    - For each of the debatebly four or five operations, the tester:
        - Uses `subprocess` to dispatch cargo to run with three command line arguments: the two hex strings and the operation (in all caps).
        - Captures the output of the process.
        - Computes the same operation using Python arithmetic operations.
        - Uses naive string comparison to compare the two values.
            - Optionally raises a debug message in the event of a difference.
- To support tester usage, I will provide:
    - The `tester.py` code
    - An example run on a partial `ix` implementation, with only addition and subtraction completed.
- I am spoiler marking both, in case you want to make your own.

### My `tester.py`

```{.py filename="tester.py"}
DEBUG = 0
CMD = "cargo run --"

import subprocess, os, random
from operator import add, sub, mul, floordiv as quo, mod as rem

bigone, bigtwo = random.randint(2 ** 500, 2 ** 512), random.randint(2 ** 500, 2 ** 512)
hexone, hextwo = hex(bigone), hex(bigtwo)
DEBUG and print("\nhexone =\n", hexone, "\nhextwo = \n", hextwo)

from operator import add, sub, mul, floordiv as quo, mod as rem
ops = {'ADD':add,'SUB':sub,'MUL':mul,'QUO':quo,'REM':rem}
for op in ops:
    result = int(subprocess.check_output(["cargo", "run", hexone, hextwo, op]),16)
    answer = ops[op](bigone,bigtwo)
    if result != answer:
        print("Operator", op, "failed.")
        DEBUG and print("Expected:")
        DEBUG and print(hex(answer))
        DEBUG and print("Received:")
        DEBUG and print(hex(result))
        exit()
    else:
        print(op, "passes.")
```

### Example output

<details>

- Note the panic caused by Rust `todo!()` and the separate, Python `subprocess.CalledProcessError` after the failure propagates back to the calling script.

# Next Steps

- Implement addition and subtraction (you will likely want to do both at the same time) and test them.
- For a hint, I wrote the following helper functions:
```rs
// Helpers: Add/sub magnitudes (absolute values) of two numbers.
// "aug" and "add" are short for "augend" and "addend"
fn add_mag(aug_vals: &Vec<u64>, add_vals: &Vec<u64>) -> Vec<u64> 
// "min" and "sub" are short for "minuend" and "subtrahend"
fn sub_mag(min_vals: &Vec<u64>, sub_vals: &Vec<u64>) -> Vec<u64> 
// Compute the "greater than or equal" between two values.
fn gte_mag(a_vals: &Vec<u64>, b_vals: &Vec<u64>) -> bool 
```
- I am also providing my entire `sub_ix`, again spoiler marked.

<details>
```{.rs}
pub fn sub_ix(a: &ix, b: &ix) -> ix {
    let b = ix {
        sign: !b.sign,
        vals: b.vals.clone(),
    };
    return add_ix(&a, &b);
}
```
